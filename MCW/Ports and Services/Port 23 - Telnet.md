Telnet is a network protocol used to virtually access a computer. It is not a secure protocol and is unencrypted. It is not normally used because it is easy to hack.

* **Â¿How to use it?**
	1. Firstly, we have to scan the machine and see if port 23 is open. To do it, we are going to use  `nmap [ip machine]` 
	2. If port 23 is open, now we are going to get into with `telnet [ip machine]`
		Now, we have to input a username and we are going to type `root` to get into the machine
	
You can see an example in [[1. Meow]]
