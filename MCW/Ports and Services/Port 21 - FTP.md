FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol for transmitting files between computers over TCP/IP.
There are some FTP types:
- Anonymous FTP - This is the most basic form of FTP. It provides support for data transfers without encrypting data or using a username and password. It is dangerous.
You can see an example in [[2. Fawn]] 

- Password-protected FTP - Â It requires a username and password.

- FTP over explicit SSL/TLS (FTPES) - This is a commonly used approach by web and file sharing services to enable secure file transfers.
