1. **Scan all the ports and determine service and version of open ports**
```bash
nmap -sV [target ip]
```
--> port 21/tcp - open - ftp


2. **Connect to the machine via "ftp"**
```bash
ftp [target ip]
	Name: Anonymous
	Password: [random]
```
--> **MACHINE PWNED!** 


3. **Capture the flag**
```bash
ftp --> get flag.txt
```
--> Transfer completed!
